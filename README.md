# celery-sqlalchemy-scheduler

A Scheduler Based Sqlalchemy for Celery.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

First you must install `celery` and `sqlalchemy`, and `celery` should be >=4.2.0.

```
$ pip install celery sqlalchemy
```

### Installing

Install from PyPi:

```
$ pip install celery-sqlalchemy-scheduler
```

Install from source by cloning this repository:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:AngelLiang/celery-sqlalchemy-scheduler.git
$ cd celery-sqlalchemy-scheduler
$ python setup.py install
```

## Usage

After you have installed `celery_sqlalchemy_scheduler`, you can easily start with following steps:

This is a demo for exmaple, you can check the code in `examples` directory

1. start celery worker

   ```
   $ celery worker -A tasks -l info
   ```

2. start the celery beat with `DatabaseScheduler` as scheduler:

   ```
   $ celery beat -A tasks -S celery_sqlalchemy_scheduler.schedulers:DatabaseScheduler -l info
   ```

# Description

After the celery beat is started, by default it create a sqlite database(`schedule.db`) in current folder. You can use `SQLiteStudio.exe` to inspect it.

When you want to update scheduler, you can update the data in `schedule.db`. But `celery_sqlalchemy_scheduler` don't update the scheduler immediately. Then you shoule be change the first column's `last_update` field in the `celery_periodic_task_changed` to now datetime. Finally the celery beat will update scheduler at next wake-up time.
